## Requirements

1. The project was implemented and tested in Python 3.5 and Pytorch 1.0. Other versions should work after minor modification.
2. NVIDIA GPU and cuDNN are required to have fast speeds. For now, CUDA 8.0 with cuDNN 6.0.20 has been tested. The other versions should be working.


## Datasets

[Butterflies and Chinese Characters](https://github.com/macaodha/explain_teach/tree/master/data), [Gull](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gjt2GIiGtvpsUoQywktP6RE0KhHunAzI/view?usp=sharing) are used. Please organize them as below after download,

## Implementation details

### To generate counterfactual explanations
```
get_all_CE_butterflies.py
get_all_CE_gull.py
```
by SimCLR model
```
get_all_CE_butterflies_simclr.py
get_all_CE_gull_simclr.py
```
### To generate teaching images and explanations
```
train_butterflies_CMaxGrad.py
train_gull_CMaxGrad.py
```
by SimCLR model
```
train_butterflies_CMaxGrad_simclr.py
train_gull_CMaxGrad_simclr.py
```

For the SimCLR, we used [repo](https://github.com/Spijkervet/SimCLR) for training. Thanks for their open-source.
For standard model, we trained by
```
train_butterflies_resnet18.py
train_gull_resnet18_linear.py
```
